    title: Intervale Manual
---
The below contains information which **you must read and follow.** This is not an online license agreement.


---
# Purpose
---

This document is intended as an instruction set for Intervale Keyholders. It is similar to the instructions told to new Keyholders during training trips. However, this document is not a substitute for a training trip. If you want to become a Keyholder for Intervale, you must attend one of these trips. 

# Keyholders

**Being an Intervale Keyholder is an important responsibility, and should not be taken lightly.**

Every group that uses Intervale must be accompanied by a Keyholder, even if the cabin itself is not being used. The purpose of this policy is to ensure that there is always at least one person at the property who is familiar with the property and the situation surrounding it, and who will be explicitly responsible for the duration of the stay.

A Keyholder is a person who has attended a full-day training trip at Intervale. These trainings teach members how to properly access and close the cabin. Keyholder training is valid for 2 years, but this validity can be extended at the cabin manager's discretion.

The Keyholder is responsible for the actions of the group and is the organizer for the stay. If there are any problems with members of the group it is then up to the Keyholder to enforce proper behavior. When the Keyholder first determines that a problem is occurring, she should first inform the group members as to how to correct the situation. If that does not resolve the problem, the Keyholder should contact the Cabin Managers upon return to Boston who will then follow up with the situation.

The reserving Keyholder MUST be present at the property for the duration of the reservation with their group. Reservations cannot be transferred to other individuals; a separate reservation request must be submitted.

**Keyholder status is contingent upon correct and dutiful observance of the rules and procedures detailed in this document. Failure to comply with (including ignorance of) any of these rules and procedures can result in loss of Keyholder status (and other disciplinary action.)**

# Special exemptions

Active members of MITOC's board of directors are allowed to stay at the cabin for free. Former cabin managers keyholder status does not expire, and they get free cabin stays for life. Both groups are required to create reservations and follow all of the other cabin policies. 

---
# Location and Access
---

Intervale is located a few miles north of North Conway, NH. The exact location of the property and the parking area are shown to Keyholders during Keyholder training. There is no street address for either. Keyholders can make whatever personal notes are needed to find the property, but should not share any information about the location of the parking area or the property.

Intervale is not road-accessible. Therefore, we have an easement which gives us a Right of Way (RoW) to access our property. Our RoW passes by a pair of other homes and directly adjacent the property of a third. It is important that you follow all of the rules below regarding our RoW when you access our property. We must respect our neighbors at all times. Failure to follow these procedures constitutes trespassing.

Please note that accessing the cabin involves a moderate 750 meter hike (usually ~10-15 minutes), with uneven terrain and one rather steep hill. In winter, it can be useful to have spikes or some additional traction to assist with footing.

### Intervale’s Neighbors

Contrary to popular belief, Intervale is not in an isolated wilderness. There are indeed neighbors, and they can be disturbed by the actions of Intervale’s users. In particular, please respect the privacy of the neighbors who live in the houses along the path up to the cabin. It is the responsibility of the Keyholder to be present during all RoW crossing by their group and ensure that everyone in their group adheres to the regulations described here.

The nearest house to Intervale is generally not visible through the trees, but it is not all that far away. Sounds carry surprisingly well. So, make sure that group remains reasonably quiet, especially at night. People from the cabin should not go wandering around on other people’s property.

### Access Rules

All of these rules must be followed at **all times** by anyone accessing the property. ***Violation of any of these policies will result in the revocation of your MITOC cabin privileges and/or MITOC membership. Additionally it could constitute criminal trespassing! NO EXCUSES!!!***

- **Everyone accessing the property must be individually named on a reservation that has been approved in advance by the cabin managers**
- **Everyone accessing the property must have filled out [MITOC's Liability Waiver](https://mitoc-trips.mit.edu/profile/waiver/)**
- **A Keyholder must escort every guest on the RoW every time the RoW is used.**
- **All members of a single reservation must arrive at the parking area together, walk to and from the property together, and depart the parking area together. Groups meeting from different origins should meet at a local business or public area and travel together from there.**
- **If at any point there is any doubt about the correct route to the cabin the group must retreat to an appropriate (public) location and contact the Cabin Managers before proceeding**
- **Whenever traveling along the right-of-way to the MITOC property, everyone must be respectful of all neighbors and maintain proper conduct:**
    - **Keep voices at appropriate levels on the road and silent between the road and the cabin.**
    - **Do not stop between the road and the cabin**
    - **Respect the privacy of neighbors in or near their homes**
    - **Use appropriate lighting at night, but do not illuminate anything outside of your direct path**
    - **Do not take anything or leave any items (such as trash) anywhere along the RoW or in the parking area**
- **No vehicles may be operated on the right-of-way to the MITOC property. (Use is reserved for cabin managers, as needed to maintain the property.)**
- **Any complaints or confrontations with neighbors or visits by the police must be reported *immediately* to the cabin managers.**

### Parking

Parking for the cabin is in a small lot. Do not park anywhere else but here, not even to unload gear. If you attempt to drive the rest of the way, you may disturb our neighbors. Please keep in mind that this parking lot is owned by the Ski Club. MITOC has been granted permission to park here under two conditions.
- **That MITOC leaves enough space such that the Ski Club can park two cars side-by-side in the lot on the right without blocking the driveway.**
- **That MITOC does not block the driveway of the Ski Club.**

In order to achieve this, drivers who arrive/depart together are encouraged to park one another in. This helps to maximize the space of the lot.

Additionally:
- **You may NOT consume alcohol, block the roadway, create any disturbance, or camp in the parking lot.**
- **Do not leave any trash in the parking area.**

# Reserving the Property
---

### Types of Use

Cabin (non-exclusive) - Staying in the cabin, sharing with any other groups who might be present

Yurt - Staying in the yurt, sharing with any other groups who might be present

Camping - Camping on the Intervale grounds (approx. 1 acre), within the tree markers

Cabin exclusive - Renting the entire cabin for a set fee

In all cases a Keyholder is responsible for all aspects of the reservation for the entire group, as detailed in this document.
Any use of the property must be explicitly approved by a Cabin Manager.

### Preparation

Try to complete planning as much as possible before submitting a reservation request. Everyone in the reservation should be aware that they are part of it and who the Keyholder responsible is. We strongly recommend keeping plans involving Intervale as simple as possible.

### Prerequisites

In order to make a reservation a Keyholder must:
- Be a [MITOC member](https://mitoc.mit.edu/join) in good standing with current Keyholder status
- Be familiar with the most recent draft of this Property Manual
- Have $1,000 in MITOC “Frequent Flyer” checks currently on file in the MITOC office to act as a deposit against any damages or legal fees incurred by your visit
- Have contact information for the current Cabin Managers on hand

### Reservation Procedure for Official MITOC Programming

Please get in touch with us as early as possible about official club programming. Major club events (e.g. Winter School) typically recieve extra support from the cabin managers.

1. Fill out the [Reservation Request Form](https://goo.gl/forms/mw87HujKgeDa6IHF3). **NOTE:** You can simply link the mitoc-trips page as opposed to providing full contact information for your group. For club programming like School of Rock, you may ask us to block out weekends months in advance while you finalize your plans.
1. A Cabin Manager will confirm receipt of your request and block off the relevant days on the calendar. Official club programming is exempt from the property exclusive fee.
1. A Cabin Manager will then email you specific, written approval to access the property. If relevant, you will also receive a cabin door code for your stay.
1. Ensure that **everyone** in your group has signed [MITOC's Liability Waiver](https://mitoc-trips.mit.edu/profile/waiver/). As long as this is an official trip, this should be automatically handled by the trips website.
1. Have the group members submit their cabin dues individually at [Pay MITOC](https://mitoc.mit.edu/pay). Typically you communicate this in a trip planning email or rideshare spreadsheet.
1. Email the checkout questionnaire (included in your request confirmation email), as well as any other relevant updates, to the Cabin Managers within 48 hours of leaving the property  

### Reservation Procedure for Personal Use 
All of these steps must be completed in order to legally access the property.

1. Fill out the [Reservation Request Form](https://goo.gl/forms/mw87HujKgeDa6IHF3). **NOTE:** The full names and contact information of every member in your party is required.
1. A Cabin Manager will confirm receipt of your request and request that you pay for your group. Please submit a payment for your entire group (we do not accept individual payments from each guest for personal reservations) at [Pay MITOC](https://mitoc.mit.edu/pay) and email the receipt as a reply to your approval email. **Fees are non-refundable**. 
1. A Cabin Manager will then email you specific, written approval to access the property. If relevant, you will also receive a cabin door code for your stay.
1. Confirm by email with the Cabin Managers that your group and plans have not changed no later than 1 day in advance of leaving for Intervale. Detail any changes if applicable.
1. Ensure that **everyone** in your group has signed [MITOC's Liability Waiver](https://mitoc-trips.mit.edu/profile/waiver/).
1. Email the checkout questionnaire (included in your request confirmation email), as well as any other relevant updates, to the Cabin Managers within 48 hours of leaving the property  
Please keep in mind that Intervale is managed by volunteers with other responsibilities, and allow ample time for response to reservation requests. (No response is a negative response.) All communication related to a particular reservation should be conducted by the responsible Keyholder and should be kept in the **same email conversation** as the original request confirmation email.
 
### Reservation Policies
- All reservations are at the discretion of the Cabin Managers. Requests can be denied on suspicion/expectation of potential issues with the visit.
- There can be a maximum of fifteen people in the cabin, and a total of twenty-five people in total on the property. At most eight cars may be parked at the designated parking area, no other vehicles are permitted on or near the MITOC property.
- We require a 1:1 ratio of members to non-members in each group
- Reservation requests for weekends must be submitted by Thursday at 11:59pm before the weekend of use.
- Reservations must all fit in one vehicle or maintain a one-to-four ratio of Keyholders to guests (or one-to-nine in the case of official MITOC trips.)
- Pets may be allowed at the discretion of the Cabin Managers. Advanced notice is required.
- Email intervale-mgr@mit.edu for more information on exclusive rentals.
 
## Communication
Any and all questions/communication about Intervale should be directed to the Cabin Managers, who can most easily be reached at intervale-mgr@mit.edu. It is especially important not to communicate the location of the cabin to anyone.

# At The Cabin
---

### Arriving

Complete the first part of the cabin checklist. Have people take their personal gear to the loft or the hooks at the far corners of the den. People have a tendency to dump their stuff in the middle of the floor, where it gets in everyone’s way. Please instruct everyone to leave their shoes/boots on the tiled floor at the door. The hardwood floors are in beautiful condition and snow, dirt, etc, from outside will quickly scratch them.

### Cleaning

Leave the cabin at least as clean as you found it. Clean all of the counters and tables. Sweep out the loft and living area. Organize the chairs and kitchen items.

Dishes and cookware that are left at the cabin must be cleaned immediately after your meal is over.

### Trash

You must pack out your own trash. It is recommended that you bring a sealable bag or container with you large enough to contain any trash you might produce on the property. The trash can and bags that are provided can be used, but it must be agreed upon in advance who will take the trash bag with them upon leaving.

### Conduct

All official events at the cabin must follow all MIT rules including the [Alcohol Policy](https://handbook.mit.edu/alcohol) and the [Nondiscrimination Policy](https://handbook.mit.edu/nondiscrimination).

In summary the alcohol policy reads as below. For any updates refer to the link above.
> “MIT prohibits any persons under the age of 21 from possessing or consuming alcohol. Additionally, MIT prohibits persons from providing, serving, or selling alcohol to any person, except as expressly allowed in Institute policy 9.11.2. Small social gatherings (usually considered to be 25 guests or fewer) at which alcohol is served to individuals over the age of 21 is not considered a violation of this policy.
MIT also prohibits inappropriate behaviors that result from the use of alcohol by persons of any age, including but not limited to public intoxication, driving while under the influence of alcohol, vandalism, and behaviors that require an intervention by Institute staff, cause a disturbance, or are a danger to persons (self or others) or property.
Other alcohol-related behaviors prohibited by MIT include but are not limited to: the possession or use of false identification to purchase alcohol, possession of open containers of alcohol in public spaces, consumption from quantity dispensing sources (e.g. kegs, punch bowls, water coolers, beer balls or garbage cans) on campus (except for events receiving the approval specified in the Event Planning Guide) or in Institute-approved housing, engaging in drinking games or other activities involving rapid and/or excessive consumption of alcohol on campus or in Institute-approved housing, and hosting events where alcohol is present or consumed without prior approval, as required by the Event Planning Guide.
MIT also adheres to the provisions concerning alcohol under the federal Drug-Free Workplace and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Acts (DFSCA).
The Institute does not intend through its guidelines or policies to restrict the responsible use of alcohol by members of the MIT community who are at or above the legal drinking age of 21. However, efforts to observe existing laws and regulations in an environment where the majority of the undergraduate student body is not of legal drinking age will impose some constraints on those who are of legal drinking age.”

### Cabin Gas and Appliances

#### Turning on the Gas

1. Ensure that every gas appliance inside the cabin is turned off.
2. Crack the top window in the cabin 1/2" to allow moisture to escape the cabin.
3. Upon arrival at the tanks first ensure all tanks are closed by checking the valve on top of each tank
4. Identify the tank marked as “IN USE”, open it by opening the valve on top of the tank
5. Below the regulator is the master shut-off. If the red lever is perpendicular to the gas line it is OFF, turn it parallel to the gas line for ON.
6. Above the regulator between the second and third tank is the bank selector. Turn it to face the direction (left or right) of the tank which you wish to use.
7. We recommend lighting the largest stove burner inside the cabin to verify gas flow. The stove is much simpler to light than the heater.

#### Stove

Once the gas is turned on, lighting the burners is rather straightforward. Turn the knob of the appropriate burned to the setting marked “light”. The stove is equipped with a battery for the lighter. If the lighter isn’t working due to a dead battery touch a match to the burner. The oven is also gas, and is lit using the same battery lighter. If the battery is dead you can light the oven with a match by carefully lighting the oven pilot under the stove toward the back. Don’t try this if you haven’t been shown how. Please make sure that the stove top is clean and sparkly white before you leave.

#### Lighting the Lamps

Each lamp has a switch on the side of it which is raised to turn the gas on. First, light a match (or use the lighter if there is one) and then turn on the gas. Now hold the flame BELOW the mantle without actually touching the match, lighter, or anything else, to the mantle. The lamp should light quickly. The mantles are extremely fragile (and expensive) so please do not touch them either with your hands, the match, the lighter, or anything else. In cold weather, it may take a few moments for the gas to flow through the line.

#### Switching Fuel Bottles

If after several tries, the stove does not light, it is possible that the current gas bottle is empty and you will need to switch the regulator to a different bottle, which is quite easy. Return to the bottles behind the cabin.
1. Turn off the main shut-off by returning the red-lever to be perpendicular to the gas line.
2. Close all tanks by closing the valves on the top of all tanks.
3. Replace the now old “IN USE” tag with an “EMPTY”
4. Pick one of the other three bottles marked as “FULL” Open this bottle by using the valve on top of it.
5. Replace the “FULL” tag with an “IN USE” tag.
6. Turn the bank selector to face the bottle you wish to use.
7. Now reopen the main shutoff by turning the red lever to the parallel position.
8. Please tell the cabin manager that one of the bottles is now empty, along with how many full bottles are remaining on the regulator.


#### Turning Off the Gas

1. Make sure ALL gas appliances inside are turned off.
2. Go behind the cabin and close ALL bottles, including the one marked as “IN USE”
3. Turn the selector knob to face directly up.
4. Turn off the master lever by turning the red lever below the regulator to be perpendicular to the gas line.  
**NOTE:** There are several other levers on various gas lines under the cabin and going into the cabin. Don’t turn those levers off. Only manipulate the levers behind the cabin as described above.

#### Propane Heater

Intervale is heated by a propane heater. Directions for lighting the furnace are found on the panel on the bottom of the heater after removing the cover. Note that it may take a full minute or two of holding the black knob down in the “PILOT” position before the spark will ignite the pilot light.


### The Kitchen 

Food should be stored in the cabinet by the stove, especially overnight. Do not leave any food in the cabin between stays. 

We hope to rebuild our well in 2023, but until then there is no reliable water source on the property. That means that it's very difficult to do dishes at this time. Groups may prepare food if they bring all of their own dishes and take those dishes home with them. 

### Fires

There is a fire ring near the cabin. This is the only place on the grounds where a fire is permissible. What is the difference between a cooking fire and a bonfire? The line is a fuzzy one, but a cooking fire is small. Thus the fires in the fire ring should be kept to a reasonably small size.

Whenever there is a fire or smoldering coals in the fire ring, someone should be supervising it. There is a tendency for a group of people to assume that someone else is managing the fire, so make sure that one person knows that he or she is responsible for the fire and will stay with the fire until it is out.

No open flames are permitted in the yurt, cabin, or any other part of the property except in the fire ring or as part of normal operation of the stove.

### Outhouse

Restroom facilities at Intervale consist of a two-stall outhouse a short distance from the cabin. The trail to the cabin is marked with reflectors so that you can find it in the dark. There should be toilet paper at the outhouse, and there is more in the cabin. Please ensure that it is protected from the animals which will quickly shred it. If the toilet paper supply is low, please tell the cabin manager .
